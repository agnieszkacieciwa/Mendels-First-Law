# Mendel's-First-Law
This program calculates the possible combinations of offspring genotypes and their ratios based on the provided parent genotypes, following the First Mendel's Law - the principle of genetic inheritance. This means that offspring inherit one allele from each parent, and the alleles segregate randomly, resulting in a 50% chance for the offspring to receive either allele. It is designed to work with genotypes following the Aa (AA, aa), Bb (BB, Bb), etc. convention.

For example, one parent with the Aa genotype has two alleles: A and a, meaning that the offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting allele A and a 50% chance of inheriting allele a (from this one parent).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `collections` module

## Usage
1. Run the program by executing the Python script.
2. Enter the genotype of the first parent according to the Aa convention.
3. Enter the genotype of the second parent according to the Aa convention.
4. The program will determine if the genotypes describe the same trait or not.
5. It will then calculate the possible combinations of offspring genotypes and display them along with their respective ratios.
